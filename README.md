# Hi, I'm Anton 👋

📍 Boulder, Colorado

I'm a generalist who's been building software for 25 years. Started coding at 12, studied finance, and have shipped products across the full stack—from low-level systems to polished UIs.

Building is the easy part. The hard part is knowing *what* to build. That's where I focus—understanding the problem, the user, and the business well enough to build the right thing the first time.

Also worked with: C, C++, Assembly, C#/.NET, Python, React Native

## What I do

- **Fractional CTO** — technical leadership for startups
- **Technical advising** — architecture, strategy, scaling
- **Hands-on building** — still love writing code and shipping

Industries: e-commerce, healthcare, edtech, SaaS

## How I think about product

- _Building it right_ isn't hard thing. _Building the right thing_ is.
- **Talk to users constantly.** Watch what they do, not just what they say.
- **First make it work, then perfect it.** Ship something usable, learn, iterate.
